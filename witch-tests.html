Another witch test that was used during the infamous Salem Witch Trials of 1692 was the “touch test.” This was used to identify witches who had cast a spell on a victim.
The idea behind this witch test was simple: if someone suddenly fell ill after being in contact with another person and then they were suddenly cured of their ailments after being touched again by that same person, then that individual who touched them was guaranteed to be a witch."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

To the judges in Salem, this proved Faulkner’s culpability and she was imprisoned and sentenced to death for witchcraft.</p><p>Faulkner narrowly escaped execution because she was pregnant and later exonerated by the town, but at least 18 people in total were tried on the basis of the dubious touch test in the Salem Witch Trials alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4tdOcn2aslajBtHuT</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carole-baskin.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Big Cat Rescue, Founder, Carole Baskin Married To?
