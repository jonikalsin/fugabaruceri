He made the bulk of his fortune in the entertainment industry as a rapper and songwriter.</strong></p><p>King Von (born Dayvon Daquan Bennett) found his way to the music spotlight after he was discovered by rapper Lil Durk, who put faith in his talents and admitted him into his record label. Before his demise in 2020, King Von proved Lil Durk right with several hits. He also acquired a relatively small fortune in the process, and this article explores the intricate process involved in raising his net worth to six figures before he died.</p><h2><strong>King Von Had A Net Worth Of $750k When He Died</strong></h2><p>King Von’s net worth at the time of his death was an estimated $750k. For someone who was in the music industry for only a short time, this figure represents the late rapper’s impressive work rate and talent.</p><p>Born Dayvon Daquan Bennett on August 9, 1994, King Von grew up in Chicago, a city known for its vibrant rap scene. As a teenager, he became involved in street life and faced numerous legal troubles, including charges related to violence and drugs. However, his passion for music provided an outlet for his experiences and emotions.</p><p>King Von gained prominence in the music industry through his affiliation with fellow Chicago rapper Lil Durk. He released his debut mixtape, Grandson Vol. 1, in 2019, which garnered attention for its raw and gritty storytelling. His lyrics painted a vivid picture of the realities of street life, resonating with audiences seeking an authentic representation of the Chicago drill rap genre.</p><h2><strong>He Acquired Most Of His Net Worth Through His Music Career</strong></h2><p>King Von made his money primarily through his music career, starting from when he first began in the industry. He gained recognition for his honest and vivid storytelling in his songs. As a rapper, he worked with various labels, including Only Family and Empire, to release his music and generate income.</p><p>His debut mixtape, Grandson Vol 1., which was released in 2019 and featured rapper Lil Durk, has 15 tracks. It rose to the 75th position on the Billboard 200 and the 27th position on the Hip Hop/R&B Albums chart in 2019.</p><h4><strong>Some of King Von’s songs he released include:</strong></h4><ul><li>2 A.M.</li><li>Rolling featuring YNW Melly</li><li>Pressin featuring Sada Baby</li><li>Took Her to the O</li><li>Grandson for President</li><li>Why He Told</li><li>All These Niggas</li><li>How It Go featuring Lil Durk</li></ul><p>In terms of the platforms he earned the most from as a recording artist, it is unclear which platforms specifically brought him the most revenue.</p><p>However, it can be assumed that streaming platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, and other major streaming services played a significant role in his income generation, as they are commonly used by artists to distribute and monetize their music.</p><p>Following the success of his debut mixtape, King Von continued to captivate listeners with his distinctive flow, vivid storytelling, and charismatic presence. His subsequent releases, including LeVon James and his debut album, Welcome to O’Block, released a couple of weeks before his death, further solidified his position in the rap industry.</p><p>King Von’s artistry was characterized by his ability to navigate seamlessly between introspective tracks and aggressive anthems. His lyrics often depicted the harsh realities of street violence, personal struggles, and the consequences of a life immersed in gang culture. His storytelling prowess and ability to convey raw emotions through his music endeared him to a growing fan base.</p><p>Apart from his music career, there is no information available regarding any other sources of income that made up King Von net worth. Therefore, it is difficult to comment on any additional sources of income he may have had.</p><h2><strong>King Von Was Killed In October 2020</strong></h2><p>Tragically, King Von’s life was cut short on November 6, 2020, at the age of 26. The circumstances surrounding his death sent shockwaves through the music industry and his dedicated fan base.</p><p>Investigations into his death reveal that on that fateful day, the late rapper got into a violent altercation with <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Quando Rondo</a> in a parking lot outside the Monoco Hookah Lounge in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>Von was shot in the process and was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. He did not survive the surgery that was supposed to save his life, and was pronounced dead later that day. The primary cause of his death was the gunshot wounds he sustained from the fight.</p><p>Further reports from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, indicated that seven others were affected in the fight, with two of the seven also joining Von in death. The primary suspect in the investigation was Timothy Leeks, who was also coincidentally one of the victims. King Von was buried On 14th November 2020, in Chicago, Illinois.</p><p>Despite his untimely demise, King Von’s impact on the rap scene remains undeniable. His authentic storytelling and raw talent continue to inspire aspiring artists, cementing his legacy as one of the notable voices of Chicago drill rap.</p><h3><strong>King Von’s Daughter May Have Inherited His Wealth</strong></h3><p>Several as-yet-unverified sources indicate that a daughter named Demi Rowe Bennett was born to King Von after his death and that she may have inherited his wealth.</p><p>At the time of his death, King Von was not signed to a record label and only had project obligations to Empire. Therefore, it is possible that he did not have a formal will or estate plan in place to dictate who would inherit his assets.</p><p>In the absence of a will, state laws would typically determine who inherits the assets of an individual who dies intestate. In King Von’s case, he was a resident of Illinois at the time of his death, and Illinois intestacy laws would apply.</p><p>According to these laws, if King Von was unmarried and had no children, his parents would inherit his assets in equal shares. However, if his parents were not alive, his siblings would be next in line to inherit.</p><p>It is worth noting that if King Von had any debt at the time of his death, it would need to be paid off before his assets could be distributed to his heirs. Additionally, if he had any assets held in trust or jointly owned with another person, those assets would pass to the designated beneficiaries or co-owners outside of the probate process.</p><p>In summary, the exact details of who inherited King Von’s wealth at the time of his death are not publicly known. However, based on Illinois intestacy laws, it is likely that his parents or siblings would have inherited them, if he did not have a will in place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLiqusZmraimXaOytXnWqKmtoF2dvLh5zK6aoWWnlsBuwMeeZKuZoKWys3nWqKmtoF2WwW7Ax55kraGdmnqwsoyhoKxllJqutbSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-vergara.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Vergara</span></a>
