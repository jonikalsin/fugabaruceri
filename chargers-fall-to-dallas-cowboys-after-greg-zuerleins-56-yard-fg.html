That pregame analysis was obvious, but there wasn’t enough attention on the defensive starters the Chargers were missing Sunday at SoFi Stadium.</p><p>Ezekiel Elliott and the Cowboys’ rushing attack got back on track against a thin Chargers defensive line without defensive tackle Justin Jones. Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott also had success against a Chargers’ secondary that missed cornerback Chris Harris Jr.</p><p>The Chargers had no answers for the Cowboys’ rushing attack, but they did enough to keep them out of the end zone for another one-score ending. But when it truly counted, the Chargers’ defense couldn’t get a stop during the final drive. The Cowboys defeated the Chargers 20-17 after Greg Zuerlein’s 56-yard field goal with time expiring.</p><p>Herbert completed 31 of 41 passes for 338 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. Prescott finished 23 of 27 for 237 yards and one interception.</p><p>The Chargers tied it 17-17 with 3:54 left in regulation after kicker Tristan Vizcaino made a 29-yard field goal.</p><p>The Chargers had an opportunity to take their first lead late in the third quarter, but Herbert threw an interception in the end zone to Damontae Kazee with the game tied 14-14. The Cowboys capitalized with a 34-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein to take a 17-14 advantage with 10:25 left in regulation.</p><p>Herbert got the Chargers’ first drive of the second half going with a 42-yard completion to wide receiver Keenan Allen near the right sideline. Vizcaino made a 32-yard field goal to tie the game 14-14 with 9:22 in the third quarter.</p><p>The Chargers shook off a sluggish start with a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to give their defense 5:28 of game time rest in the second quarter. Wide receiver Mike Williams got past multiple defenders near the left sideline to cross the end zone on a 12-yard reception. Running back Austin Ekeler converted the 2-point conversion on a run to trim the Cowboys’ lead 14-11 with 9:49 in the second quarter.</p><p>Prescott and the Cowboys offense had no issues against Brandon Staley’s defense in the first quarter. The Cowboys had two touchdowns, 174 total yards and 13 first downs with a 14-3 lead heading into the second quarter.</p><p>Vizcaino made a 46-yard field goal to give the Chargers their only points of the first quarter. Chargers rookie cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. grabbed his first career regular-season interception to give the offense good field position before Vizcaino’s field goal.</p><p>The Cowboys extended their opening drive after linebacker Kyzir White was called for pass interference on fourth-and-1 near midfield. They capitalized on the Chargers’ mistake after running back Tony Pollard recorded a 4-yard touchdown run to give the Cowboys a 7-0 lead in the first quarter.</p><p>Linebacker Kenneth Murray injured his ankle on the opening drive, but returned from the locker room and entered the game on the following drive. Prescott got the touchdown drive going with a 20-yard completion to tight end Blake Jarwin.</p><p>Later in the first quarter, Elliott scored on a 4-yard touchdown run to extend their lead 14-3 with 17 seconds in the first quarter.</p><p>The Chargers were fortunate to go into halftime down 14-11 because Elliott nearly crossed the goal line after receiving a lateral from wide receiver CeeDee Lamb on a play that started with three seconds left in the second quarter.</p><p>Chargers safety Derwin James pushed Elliott out of bounds at the 3-yard line. It was the first ever 14-11 halftime score in NFL history.</p><p>This story will be updated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk52us7PEq6pmnpGhuW7AzmabmqSclsBur86wmaixo2Kup8DEq2SgqpWcervBxKujnqGeqHp2goyymKucXZu0cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vsauce.html><span>←</span><span>Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
