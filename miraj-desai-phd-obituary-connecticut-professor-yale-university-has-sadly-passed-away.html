Dr. Desai’s sudden departure has left a void in the hearts of those who had the privilege of knowing him and has left the field of mental health research poorer for his absence.&nbsp;Dr. Miraj Desai served as an assistant professor at the Program for Recovery and Community Health (PRCH) within the Yale University School of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry.

His multifaceted roles included serving as a Resident Fellow of Pierson College, affiliating with the Center on Climate Change and Health and the Yale School of Public Health, participating as a member of the South Asian Studies Council, and founding the Structural Health and Psychology (SHP) lab.</p><p>As a researcher, Dr. Desai’s work was characterized by a deep understanding of the intersections between mental health, societal structures, and environmental factors. His expertise in these areas made him a sought-after collaborator and mentor, and his impact extended beyond the academic realm.&nbsp;In addition to his scholarly pursuits, Dr. Desai’s leadership qualities were evident in the countless lives he touched through his mentorship and guidance. Colleagues and students remember him not only for his intellectual brilliance but also for his kindness, humility, and genuine concern for the well-being of those around him.</p><p>The Structural Health and Psychology lab, a testament to Dr. Desai’s innovative spirit, was a hub for cutting-edge research that aimed to bridge the gap between mental health and broader structural influences.
