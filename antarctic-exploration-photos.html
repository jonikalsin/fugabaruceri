It’s been a little over one hundred years since the ill-fated attempts of Captain Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition and Ernest Shackleton’s Ross Sea Party to reach the South Pole took place. Only conducted a couple years apart, these two Antarctic expeditions are legends of loss and tragedy. Source: The Mirror
The two voyages have more in common than their quests to reach the South Pole, the use of the same supply shacks en route, and similar fates; they’ve both had lost photos turn up nearly 100 years after the fact."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The photos of his final months had been presumed lost for decades, but finally resurfaced in 2001 in the basement of a major photography agency. The photos were sold off at a New York auction house, with ownership battles being fought for some time before they were able to be released to the public.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28707 alt="Antarctic Exploration Mountain Face" width=800 height=581 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AntarcticNegativesMountainFace.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28707 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Huffington Post</a></p><p>Though not a photographer- and only briefly trained by crew photographer Herbert Ponting- through film Scott was able to immortalize aspects of the treacherous terrain and hardships suffered in the months leading up to his death.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28702 alt="Antarctic Exploration Covered Shelter" width=800 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AntarcticNegativesCoveredShelter.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28702 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Robinson Frames</a></p><p>Until recently, the re-emergence of Scott’s photos had been the biggest find of the Antarctic voyages. That is until a frozen chunk of celluloid was found in one of Captain Scott’s supply shacks, which was discovered to have been later used by members of Shackleton’s party. The celluloid block comprised 22 severely damaged photos (understandably so), presumably taken by the crew photographer of the Ross Sea Party. According to the Antarctic Heritage Trust, the identity of the photographer is not known, although the expedition’s main photographer was Arnold Patrick Spencer-Smith.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28701 alt="Antarctic Exploration Clumped Celluloid" width=800 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AntarcticNegativesClumpedCelluloid.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28701 class=wp-caption-text>The uncovered celluloid block. Source: <a href=#>Gear Junkie</a></p><p>Attempting to be the first man to cross the Antarctic by land to reach the South Pole, Ernest Shackleton took advantage of many of the same shacks that had been built by Captain Scott and his men, deciding to follow the steps of fatal failure instead of forging his own path. Shackleton never made it to the South Pole, however; he died of a heart attack in South Georgia.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28700 alt="Antarctic Exploration Aurora Iceberg" width=800 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AntarcticNegativesAuroraIceberg.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28700 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>NPR</a></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28708 alt="Antarctic Exploration Scott Ship" width=800 height=533 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AntarcticNegativesScottShip.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28708 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Wired</a></p><p>The negatives were found at Captain Scott’s final expedition base at Cape Evans. Located in the dark room that had been setup by Herbert Ponting, the images have been painstakingly conserved and restored, revealing never before seen images of the Antarctic landscape and even some of Shackleton’s crew — all in all, a treasure trove of <a href=#>Antarctica facts and pictures</a>. Two of the better preserved and restored images display Ernest Shackleton’s Chief Scientist, Alexander Stevens. These two photographs in particular evoke a certain uneasiness in their black and white serenity, as the viewer knows full well what is about to befall the expedition.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28699 alt="Antarctic Exploration Alexander Stevens" width=800 height=533 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AntarcticNegativesAlexanderStevens.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28699 class=wp-caption-text>Scientist Alexander Stevens Source: <a href=#>3 News</a></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28705 alt="Antarctic Exploration Iceberg View" width=800 height=613 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AntarcticNegativesIcebergView.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28705 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>New Zealand Ministry Of Culture And Heritage</a></p><p>To date, more than 10,000 items have been recovered from Captain Scott’s Cape Evans Hut.
