Things between the marriage recently went wild again when he revealed to having an affair with his employee. Ralph treated Drew to a lavish meal to make up for their continuous turmoil.&nbsp;While things seemed to be going well, Drew brought up the issue in their relationship just before dessert. This irritated Ralph, who abruptly stopped the meal and went away. Drew and Ralph went to couple‚Äôs counseling when RHOA resumed this week. She expressed her husband‚Äôs lack of appreciation and respect for her.</p><p>Ralph objected in response to Drew‚Äôs remark,</p><p>‚ÄúI offer her things that any lady would want. What about this one? Everything seems to be an issue for her since she is insatiable! That night, I offered her steak and lobster. That night, honestly? She was deserving of a Lunchable.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kenya-Moore-2.jpg alt="Kenya Moore" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Dr. Ken then instructed the couple to participate in a 30-day cease-fire experiment during which they were not to dispute. But it didn‚Äôt last long, since Ralph began all over again a few days later on their vacation to New York. During their discussion with the other housewives, The RHOA star said that she couldn‚Äôt get over the notion that there was another lady.</p><p>Ralph responded, stating,</p><p>‚ÄúI had no choice but to terminate the helper.‚Äù ‚ÄúI believe the issue is, how do you ultimately get over it and say, ‚ÄòThis occurred in the past, and now we can go on.'‚Äù</p><p>Kandi Burruss didn‚Äôt give Ralph the ultimate word so easily. She questioned him whether being so close to his helper didn‚Äôt seem insane to him. But it didn‚Äôt deter Ralph, who was ready to respond.&nbsp;Kenya resolved to step up and confront Ralph since his conduct was unacceptable.&nbsp;Kenya confronted Ralph, revealing that he was tearing Drew down while she was in pain. She went on to claim that she would have been angry if she had been in the same scenario and someone had said this to her face.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kenya-Moore-3.jpg alt="Kenya Moore" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‚ÄúSee, let me tell you something right now.
