After spotting Travis in the video using a wheelchair, his fans were alarmed.</span></h3><p>While Post Malone was performing in Nashville as part of his most recent 12 Carat Tour, Travis was seen having fun backstage. Billy Strings, a guitarist, and Luke Bryan, a country music performer, joined them on stage. On social media, Strings posted a few images from the encounter along with a video of Post and Travis playing beer pong.</p><p>In the video, Travis is seen sitting in his wheelchair and throwing a ping-pong ball. Post Malone allegedly played one of Travis’ songs as he left the stage, according to Strings, who claimed that Travis saw the entire performance. Travis referred to Post Malone as the “nicest man in the world” while sharing a TikTok video of the beer pong match.</p><h2><span id=Why_did_Randy_Travis_appear_in_the_Post_Malone_music_video_in_a_wheelchair>Why did Randy Travis appear in the Post Malone music video in a wheelchair?</span></h2><p>Fans of Randy Travis were alarmed to see him in a wheelchair in a Billy Strings beer pong video. Travis’ 2013 stroke is thought to be the cause of the wheelchair, however, the precise cause has not yet been made public.</p><p>In July 2013, Travis was admitted to the hospital with viral cardiomyopathy as a result of an upper respiratory viral infection. He then experienced a stroke and required surgery to ease the pressure on his brain. But when Travis woke up following surgery a few days later, his heart was beating on its own.</p><p>After being released, he went to a physical rehabilitation facility, but despite therapy, he had aphasia. He had to use a cane for a while as a result. By November 2014, he was somewhat able to walk. Although he has mostly been wheelchair-bound ever since the stroke, he has gradually developed the ability to walk short distances.</p><p>Mary, Randy’s wife, told Rolling Stone in 2021 that she was not ready to accept that her husband would be confined to a bed for the rest of his life due to his stroke. She said there were many ups and downs in Randy’s recovery.</p><h2><span id=Randy_Travis_Who_Is_He>Randy Travis: Who Is He?</span></h2><p>Early in his career, Randy Travis’ demo recordings received harsh criticism and were rejected by several record labels. Later, he performed as Randy Ray at The Nashville Palace. He self-released the CD Live at the Nashville Palace in 1982, and this helped him land a deal with Warner Bros Records.</p><p>Throughout his career, Travis released about 20 albums and 50 singles. He became well-known in the middle of the 1980s because of his album Storms of Life. He left Warner Bros. Records in 1997 to join DreamWorks Records, then Word Records.</p><p>The Rainmaker, Black Dog, Texas Rangers, National Treasure 2, and more movies and television shows starred the 63-year-old actor. He has won numerous awards, including GMA Dove Awards, AMA Awards, CMA Awards, and ACM Awards.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>According To Evan Roberts, Every Women Is A Hero For Surviving Childbirth</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>YouTube star</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kapuzenwurm</a></h3>Kapuzenwurm estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
