She hasn’t revealed any information about her family because she appears to be reserved. Her family has been reading the news in the morning and evening since she was a toddler. That’s how she became interested in the news, but things took a turn for the worst when her family was stranded in Hurricane Rita in 2005. They were forced to sit in the hotel lobby and watch television for news updates due to the evacuation.</p><p>Peyton kept watching their fearless reporting and was inspired by their guts, so he decided to pursue a career in journalism.
