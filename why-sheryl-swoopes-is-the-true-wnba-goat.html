Michael Jordan is still the mainstream pick as the greatest ever to play in the NBA, although LeBron James is making perhaps the most convincing case for dethroning His Royal Airness.</span></p><p><span>In women's basketball, the GOAT debate is equally as fierce, with many worthy candidates for the title. But there can only be one true WNBA GOAT, and her name is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheryl Swoopes</a>.</span></p><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheryl Swoopes</a> shares a fair bit of similarities with Jordan to justify her true GOAT status. Like MJ, she was a champion during the 1997 and 1998 seasons. And while Jordan three-peated twice with the Chicago Bulls, Swoopes did one better than Jordan as she helped the Houston Mercury win the championship in the WNBA’s first four seasons.</span></p><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheryl Swoopes</a> was overshadowed by teammate and four-time WNBA Finals MVP Cynthia Cooper during their dynastic run, but she eventually stepped out of Cooper's shadow and solidified herself as a true all-time great in succeeding seasons.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Not only was she was named the league’s Most Valuable Player three times over the next five years - a record she still shares with two other women (Lisa Leslie and Lauren Jackson) to this day - but she also claimed three Defensive Player of the Year awards as she displayed the level of two-way dominance that Jordan and few other basketball greats could reach.</span></p><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheryl Swoopes</a>' stellar resume says it all, really. She is a winner, a champion, an all-around amazing player on both ends of the court. That is why she is the WNBA GOAT.</span></p><p><span>And if you too are a believer that Swoopes truly is the greatest women's basketball player of all time, then just head on over to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheryl Swoopes</a>’ Fan Arch collection to cop her great-looking shirts, hoodies, and more!</span></p><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheryl Swoopes</a> and 800+ professional athletes and influencers have personalized merchandise on the Fan Arch’s website!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Fan Arch aims to transcend the narrative by making it easier to bridge the gap between athletes, influencers, and their fans.
