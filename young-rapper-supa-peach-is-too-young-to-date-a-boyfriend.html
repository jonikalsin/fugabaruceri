Meet the rapper Supa Peach who at her young age has already set up a high standard of performance. Is all the work affecting her dating life? Find out this and all about her real name and much more.</p><p>Yes, Supa Peach is a 14-year-old rapper from the Virgin Islands who has been performing ever she turned 10. She started on an official musical venture after she participated in the children’s talent show ‘The Rap Game.’ Now slowly but steadily, she is making her mark as an artist. After being a rising star she has already become a topic of gossip, and everybody wants to know about her personal life and if she has a boyfriend. Peach has avoided such questions related to her personal life, so we are not sure if she has a boyfriend or not.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BacXqtHhu2h/?taken-by=_supapeach</p><p>While it is unclear if she is single or has a boyfriend, it is pretty clear that her musical career is only going forward. She also has started on social media and her Youtube account has a total of more than 250,000 subscriptions.</p><h2>Supa Peach’s Brother, Sister, and Family</h2><p>Peach’s talent is not the only thing that is responsible for her growing success. The support and collaboration of her family members are also what has helped her build her career for herself especially her older sister who likes to go by the similar alias of Precious Peach who is her manager.</p><p>Precious Peach is also a former contestant on Lifetime’s ‘The Rap Game.’ Her daughter who goes by the name ‘Mini peach’ also has her own Youtube channel. She also has a brother that she mentions a lot in her Instagram account which must mean that she is very proud of him.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BXMr2YinL9o/?taken-by=_supapeach</p><h3>Supa Peach Ethnicity & Biography</h3><p>Supa Peach was born on 7th March 2003 in Virgin Islands, USA. She is famous for her alias as Supa Peach which originated after her real name, Peachez and Supa since whenever she did anything, she “killed it.” She had interests in singing since a very young age and started to perform in birthdays and parties ever since she was ten years old. After ‘The Rap Game’ even when she did not win, she opened up to new opportunities.&nbsp;As of 2017, she is 14 years of age, standing 5 feet tall and her current net worth spanning around an estimated 100,000 dollars.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BWBEJFyH7Wz/?taken-by=_supapeach</p><p>Her dark skin complexion and curly hair might get her mistaken for a person with African-American ethnicity, but in fact, she is part Hispanic and part Pacific Islander regarding ethnicity and has even grown up in Puerto Rico.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7jIr5yuqJSWwaZ6wqikaLGfqruoedGap6mdomLAtrzAZqeemZOdeqq%2FjK2mqGWppMKvs4ytpmackamybq2Mm6aynqKesq%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-principal.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Principal Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Divorcee, Facts</span></a>
