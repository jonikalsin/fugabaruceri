Since Jenna Ortega once dressed up as Pete Davidson's ex-girlfriend, Ariana Grande, the idea of the Wednesday actress and Pete dating has unexpectedly gained a lot of attention. Many people have expressed their unvarnished opinions about it on Twitter. The majority of Jenna's admirers merely want to protect her because they love her too much and don't want her to be with him.</strong></p><p>The Addams Family, created by American artist <strong>Charles Addams</strong>, is featured on Netflix's <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Wednesday</a></strong>. The main focus of the narrative is on the eponymous heroine, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jenna Ortega</strong></a>, who enrolls at Nevermore Academy, a boarding school for children with special abilities. Wednesday Addams looks into the mysterious pasts of her parents, Morticia and Gomez, to make sense of all the changes happening around her and discovers some unexpected facts.</p><p>Charles Addams created The Addams Family in the early 20th century as a satirical parody of the image of the perfect American family. They are an affluent, unconventional, and macabrely inclined elite group. Since the family's 1938 debut, the Addams Family franchise has expanded substantially and now encompasses novels, TV programs, video games, plays, and movies. And each of these versions offers a unique take on these characters.</p><p>Jenna Ortega, who is most known for her work in horror films, plays the deadly Wednesday Addams in the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Netflix</a></strong> original Wednesday. The protagonist is Morticia and Gomez Addams' gothic deadpan daughter, who is expelled from her old high school and sent to Nevermore Academy, a school for outcasts.</p><p>Jenna Ortega is incredibly popular, as evidenced by the millions of fans she has amassed on social media, particularly among younger audiences. Fans of Jenna are currently concerned about her <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>relationship</a></strong> with <strong>Pete Davidson</strong>. So, what has truly occurred, then? Why are they being discussed online? Let's look into it.</p><p>Previously, we touched on <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jenna Ortega's ethnicity</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jenna Ortega's Sexuality</strong></a>.</p><h2>Fans Believe Wednesday Actress Jenna Ortega and Pete Davidson, 29, Will Date Each Other in the Future!</h2><p>Since <strong>Jenna Ortega</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@jennaortega</a>) once <a href=# rel=noopener>dressed</a> up as <strong>Pete Davidson's</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@petedavidson</a>) ex-girlfriend, <strong>Ariana Grande </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@arianagrande</a>), the idea of the Wednesday actress and Pete dating has unexpectedly gained a lot of attention on social media. Right now, people are merely speculating about what it might be like if Pete and Jenna got together.</p><p>As per <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sun</a>, some believe the Wednesday star Jenna and Pete, 29, will date each other soon. This isn't like previous celebrity relationship rumors, which typically include a foreign tryst or a rare public sighting as their source. A Twitter user posted images of Jenna and Pete merging, sparking an internet discussion. <span>Many people have expressed their unvarnished opinions about it on Twitter, with the <a href=# rel=noopener>caption</a>;</span></p><p><strong>It will take place. Even though none of us want it, we must prepare ourselves for it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>More than 130k people have liked it, over 7k have retweeted it, and many have commented on the tweet. Even though the post is a joke about Pete's erratic love life, Jenna's supporters were eager to defend her in the comments, and their replies are amusing. Along with a picture of a man being struck in a ring (@9tailsforDorian) replied,</p><p><strong>DELETE THIS,</strong></p><p>Another user, who included a reaction photo of <strong>Drake</strong> and rapper <strong>Future</strong>, wrote,</p><p><strong>Life was good until you posted that sh*t.</strong></p><p>All these comments are reasonable because he has dated several well-known faces. Following relationships with <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>, <strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong>, Ariana Grande, and other well-known and attractive women, Pete Davidson has reportedly started dating <strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong>. He has unquestionably benefited from his charisma, height, and sense of humor in the dating world. Even though not many people had an issue with the ladies he previously chose, Jenna Ortega's admirers have made it abundantly clear that the Wednesday actress is off-limits.</p><p>Even though Ariana and Pete's relationship was brief, it is still widely discussed. They started dating in May 2018 and became engaged shortly after, but five months later they decided to call it quits. Even though the well-known couple separated, Jenna and <strong>Asher</strong> continued to dress like them for Just Jared's Halloween Party in 2018. They reportedly told the news organization that they had planned their costumes weeks before the cancellation of the engagement, so they decided to go forward with them anyhow.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGihnqaelnqwvtOenpploJrBpnnDmq2inKOku3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gong-min-jung.html><span>←</span><span>Gong Min-Jung - Bio, Nationality, Height, Net Worth, Single, Facts</span></a>
