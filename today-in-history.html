Also known as the “Virgin Queen,” Elizabeth never married or had children, instead dedicating herself to her job and her country.</p><p>Her nearly 45-year reign became known as the “Elizabethan era” and was marked by flourishing English drama and relative religious tolerance. She was the last ruler of the House of Tudor and was succeeded by her distant cousin, James I.</p><h2>1818: Queen Charlotte Dies</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-392028 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/queen-charlotte-with-her-two-eldest.jpeg alt="Queen Charlotte" width=800 height=701 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-392028 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Queen Charlotte with her two eldest children.

Her 57-year marriage to King George III produced 15 children, including the future kings George IV and William IV as well as Prince Edward, the father of Queen Victoria. King George III had been placed under Charlotte’s guardianship seven years earlier when he was declared insane, and it’s likely he never even knew his wife had died.</p><h2>1894: H. H. Holmes Is Arrested</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-392027 alt="H. H.

During the trial that followed, Holmes confessed to 26 additional murders, though he could only officially be tied to nine.</p><p>Two months prior to his arrest, <a href=# rel=noopener>H. H. Holmes</a> had knocked Pitezel unconscious with chloroform and then burned his body in order to collect his life insurance. Holmes was hanged for the crime 18 months after his arrest.</p><p class=wp-caption-text><br><br><span class=caption-body>Listen above to the History Uncovered podcast, episode 98: The Truth Behind The Legend Of H.

As one of the major figures of the New Hollywood era, Scorsese directed films such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and The Wolf of Wall Street. Much of Scorsese’s work is inspired by his upbringing in New York City. His films feature extreme violence, profanity, and the use of freezeframes and slow motion. Five of his films are held at the Library of Congress for being of “cultural, historic, or aesthetic significance.”</p><h2>1972: Tony Baekeland Murders His Mother</h2><p>American socialite <a href=# rel=noopener>Barbara Daly Baekeland</a> is killed by her 25-year-old son, Tony, at her London home.</p><p>Tony was gay and Barbara had allegedly tried to “cure” her son by coercing him to sleep with her. On November 17, Tony stabbed his mother with a kitchen knife in her penthouse. When police arrived, he was on the phone ordering Chinese food. He would later attempt to murder his grandmother and he died by suicide in prison in 1981.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ56kw6a5wZ6pZmln</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcel-cunningham.html><span>←</span><span>Marcel Cunningham-Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</span></a>
