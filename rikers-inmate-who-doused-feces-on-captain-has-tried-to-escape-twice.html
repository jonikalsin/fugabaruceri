When he was originally booked on assault charges in 2019, he hurled human waste at an officer while inside central booking at the Manhattan criminal courthouse, court records show.&nbsp;</p><p>Two days later, he was charged again for allegedly punching and trying to choke a court officer at central booking, sources previously told The Post.&nbsp;</p><p>Given Brown’s history, Ferraiuolo said the most recent incident against Lacroix never should’ve happened.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Patrick Ferraiuolo, the president of the CCA, said Brown has also repeatedly attacked corrections officers.<span class=credit>Gary Hershorn/Getty Images</span></figure><p>“When an inmate behaves that way and throws feces at uniformed staff, he needs to be isolated, he needs to be put in punitive segregation, there should be no exhausting of time when it comes to an inmate this violent and this dangerous,” Ferraiuolo fumed.&nbsp;</p><p>“Yet, they continue to coddle the inmate. Not only has he not been put in punitive segregation, he remains in the same housing area where he has assaulted three of my captains with feces and other staff members.”&nbsp;</p><p>The incident comes as the DOC is working to combat<a href=#> a number of staff resignations</a> due to dangerously long work hours, <a href=#>“inhumane conditions” and short staffing</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The DOC didn’t return a request for comment.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnop64pr7SZqCnpZGpsm7Dx6hknaelqLKlecWemp6rXaS7bq%2FAqauaoZ5itaK%2FjK2pop2UYsGwecSsmpqolWLBuLXCnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-todosey.html><span>←</span><span>Glance At The Life Of Jordan Todosey</span></a>
