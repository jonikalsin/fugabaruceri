Her role as Jen Harding remains as promising as it has always been, and Christina has done an excellent job of bringing it to life.</p><p style=color:#252525>The show’s production was halted for five months following the actress’s diagnosis, but she was determined to return to work and finish it because she felt she had an “obligation to Liz and Linda, to our story.”</p><p style=color:#252525>Christina’s ability to embrace difficult changes in her life—both on and off screen—is truly inspirational, and fans admire her for it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/64113031-0-image-a-10_1667395831903.jpg alt="Christina Applegate reveals she gained 40 pounds following MS diagnosis | Daily Mail Online" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Why Does The Actress Use Walking Sticks?</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>Christina is not seen using a walking stick on the show, but she did use one to support herself during the Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony. She has also come to accept that this is her “new normal.”</p><p style=color:#252525>MS is an auto-immune disease that affects the sheath that covers nerve fibres, resulting in communication issues between the brain and the rest of the body.</p><p style=color:#252525>Numbness, tingling, pain, fatigue, memory problems, blindness, and paralysis are among the symptoms. The condition has the potential to cause permanent nerve damage or degeneration.</p><p style=color:#252525>During the ceremony, she was also seen barefoot. She explained on Twitter, sharing a photo of the same shoe, that “for some with Ms., the feeling of shoes may hurt or make us feel off balance.” “So I was me today.” Barefoot”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have a very important ceremony coming up. This will be my first time out since diagnosed with MS. Walking sticks are now part of my new normal. Thank you <a href=# rel=noopener>@neowalksticks</a> for these beauties. Stay tuned to see which ones make the cut for a week of stuff. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/O543p1G4vS</a></p><p>— christina applegate (@1capplegate) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 27, 2022</a></p><h2><strong>Dead To Me Season 3 Is On Netflix</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>The final season of Dead to Me was released on Netflix yesterday, and all ten episodes are now available to watch.</p><p style=color:#252525>Season 3 is full of twists and turns as Jen and Judy’s involvement in two murders is investigated.</p><p style=color:#252525>The show’s humour remains high as the actors demonstrate their comedic abilities.
