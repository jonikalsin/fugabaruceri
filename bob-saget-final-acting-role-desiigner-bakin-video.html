Bob Saget was always at his best when he was making people laugh. In what appears to be the late comedian’s final acting role, he proved on point by playing a hilarious house party chef for Desiigner’s latest music video “Bakin.” Alongside adult film star Kendra Sunderland, Bob looks to be having a good time cooking up bacon — and stacks of cash — for the Hollywood Hills shindig."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In usual Bob fashion, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Full House</a> alum cracks up not only the rapper, but also the production crew as well. With the “Bakin” song playing in the background and Bob bopping to the beat, he hilariously reports to Desiigner, “I’m just here to have bacon.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The “Bakin” video was shot in December, just a few weeks before Bob’s untimely death on January 9 in an Orlando, Florida <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hotel room, </a>according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>.&nbsp;The end of the video includes a tribute to Bob with extra footage from the music video shown and “Rest In Peace Bob Saget” displayed over it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bob-Saget-Plays-House-Party-Chef-In-Desiigners-Bakin-Video-For-Final-Acting-Role-Before-Death-EMBED2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Last week, the cause of Bob’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>unexpected death</a> was revealed. His family confirmed on Feb. 9 that he died from “head trauma” on Jan. 9, following his Jacksonville, Florida stand-up comedy show. An autopsy revealed he hit his head and died from a “brain bleed.” “In the weeks since Bob’s passing, we have been overwhelmed with the incredible outpouring of love from Bob’s fans, which has been a great comfort to us and for which we are eternally grateful,” his family said in a statement to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “Now that we have the final conclusions from the authorities’ investigation, we felt it only proper that the fans hear those conclusions directly from us.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5ByZpunkmLAorPErWSfoZ6WuW6twq2gp59dp7ytsYydnKyhmZy7pr6Mm5ikoZ5iw6qwxKhm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abby-huntsman-married-husband-pregnant-baby-html.html><span>←</span><span>Abby Huntsman &amp;amp; Husband: Family Perfected By Baby Girl's Arrival - Adorable Journey</span></a>
