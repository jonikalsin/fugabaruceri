The latter of the two contests will pit the Cleveland Browns against the Pittsburgh Steelers at 8:15 p.m. <span class=caps>EST</span> on <span class=caps>ABC</span> and <span class=caps>ESPN</span>+.</p><p>Ahead of kickoff, the Browns are favored by 2 points on the spread. The game total is set at over/under 38.5 points. If choosing to wager instead on the player prop market, we have three prop leans for tonight’s matchup!</p><p>Don’t live in a state with sports betting this football season?

Moore lined up in the slot for 29 of 51 offensive snaps in Week 1 against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Pittsburgh Steelers’ primary defender in the slot last weekend was Chandon Sullivan. Sullivan has allowed six career touchdowns and a 68.7% completion rate in his career. He has struggled mightily across the last three seasons, with plenty of yards after the catch allowed and a fairly high rate of missed tackles. This is good value on Moore, especially if ends up on the sidelines.</p><h4>Anytime Touchdown Scorer (+300), PointsBet</h4><p>has already been ruled out for this evening’s contest, leaving as the top receiving threat in the passing game for . Pickens has a tough matchup tonight against a strong Cleveland secondary unit, but he has a two-inch height advantage on Greg Newsome II and a four-inch height advantage on Denzel Ward, who are Cleveland’s two primary out-wide cornerbacks. At significant plus money, this is worth a roll of the dice.</p><h2><strong><span class=caps>NFL</span> <span class=caps>DFS</span> Pick’em</strong></h2><h4>Less Than 1.5 Pass + Rush + Receiving Touchdowns, PrizePicks</h4><p>looked good, but not great in Week 1 against a bad Cincinnati secondary unit. He can get a pass for some of his poor throws due to the inclement weather, but other throws that he missed should be made in all environmental circumstances. Heading into Week 2, Watson will be down his All-Pro right tackle due to injury, with a rookie replacement keeping TJ Watt at bay. Do not be surprised if Watson struggles again on Monday.</p><p>Check out more <a href=#><span class=caps>DFS</span> sites</a> with Fantasy Football pick’em and check out our <a href=#>Betr Picks promo code</a>.</p><h6>Image Credit: Getty Images</h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqn6m8qL7Ip5ueqqNjsLC5jpqpraGTobK0e8GrprCmo2LDtHnSrZyepJWnwG680ainrGWgoa66sdFmp6udlJ6wtbXOp6pma2lpgHqAlQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-mortgage-deal-for-short-html.html><span>←</span><span>New mortgage deal for short</span></a>
