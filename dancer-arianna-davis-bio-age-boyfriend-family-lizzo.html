What happened? Who is she? Who are her family members?

Allegations and claims, including the incident at the Amsterdam club, were listed in detail in the lawsuit. At one point, it was alleged that during the night, Lizzo “turned her attention to Arianna and began pressuring Arianna to touch the breasts of one of the nude women.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Arianna had declined various times but the singer had “goaded” her to touch the nude woman and claimed the chanting “grew louder and more strident, demanding a visibly uncomfortable Ms. Davis to engage with the performer.” After documenting a meeting with other dancers and the vocalist in April, she was later fired. The dancer decided to videotape because she had an eye problem that made her feel “disoriented.”</p><p>Upon finding out, the suit states, “Lizzo became furious, hurling expletives at the group and stated that she was going to go around the room, person-by-person until someone told Lizzo who made the recording.” Arianna was ‘berated’ and then immediately dismissed on the spot despite admitting to taping but insisting the video was deleted and that she never intended any damage.</p><p>Filming of the reality TV show began in August 2021. During one episode, contestants of the show were told they would be&nbsp;<a class=gnt_ar_b_a href=# rel=noopener data-t-l=:b|e|k|${u}>required to participate in a nude photo shoot</a>, which distressed Davis. “Ms. Davis broke down in tears on set while struggling to choose between a once-in-a-lifetime career opportunity and putting her body on display against her will,” the lawsuit states. “This experience foreshadowed the sexually charged and uncomfortable environment Lizzo’s employees would be forced to endure.”</p><p>Arianna claims that Lizzo and choreographer Tanisha Scott made “thinly veiled” remarks about her weight on April 21 when they accused her of not being devoted to her work on the dance team. According to the lawsuit, Arianna said Lizzo brought up her weight during the South by Southwest music festival. Her co-dancer was let go by Lizzo’s production manager a week later in a hotel lobby “under the guise of budget cuts,” according to the lawsuit.</p><p>According to the complaint, Arianna was let go on May 3 after filming a discussion the dancers had with Lizzo regarding their performances.</p><h3><strong>Dancer Arianna Davis Career</strong></h3><p>Dancer Arianna Davis has been a technically trained dancer since she was 2 years old, studying styles including ballet, tap, jazz, musical theater, lyrical, contemporary, hip hop, and modern. Before joining the show, she held a range of professions including barista, Sunday school teacher, Broadway goods seller, Uber Eats driver, and more.</p><p>In addition to painting, cooking, playing with her dog, and singing and songwriting (she aspires to one day become a recording artist), Arianna enjoys other creative pursuits as well. She enjoys Lizzo’s tracks “Cuz I Love You” and “Heaven Help Me.”</p><p>Arianna graduated from Warren Central High School located in Indianapolis. She participated in Lizzo’s hiring process for her newest dancers on the Emmy Award-winning reality series Watch Out for the Big Grrrls. After being chosen, Arianna went on tour with Lizzo in September 2022. In October 2022, Arianna described the tour experience to the Indianapolis Star, saying, “The energy is amazing. I’m on tour with my best friends. So it’s just like, being around family 24/7, which makes the experience just heightened even more.”</p><p>Announcing that she was embarking on a “new chapter” and posting images from her trip, Arianna posted a statement on Instagram on May 5th, 2023.</p><h3><strong>Dancer Arianna Davis Age</strong></h3><p>Arianna Davis, Lizzo’s former dancer, is 24 as of Aug 2023.</p><h3><strong>Dancer Arianna Davis Family</strong></h3><p>Dancer Arianna Davis’s parents are named Jeff Davis and Lorie Davis.
