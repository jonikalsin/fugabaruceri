Not only did he play for Westgate, Lancaster, and Silverdale in the past, but he was also a significant figure in junior cricket in the Lancaster district. He played for all three of those teams. During the course of his career, he played for all three of those teams. A great number of people will never forget Brian’s dedication to the sport, not to mention the leadership he displayed during the 1960s while serving as captain of Silverdale’s first squad.</p><p>It was during his leadership that the team captured the Division 4 championship, and it was also under his leadership that Silverdale established itself as a leader in the sport. For those folks who are interested in paying their respects to him and attending his burial, the following information is provided: The day in question is the 15th of November, 2023, which falls on a Wednesday.</p><p>At eleven o’clock in the morning, you can visit the Thurnham Catholic Church, which is located at the following address: LA2 0DT.<br>Following the funeral service, the burial will take place in Scotforth Cemetery, and afterwards, friends and family will gather at the Fox and Goose Pub for a meal together. People who knew Brian can take advantage of this occasion to get together, reminisce about the fun times they shared with him, and offer mutual support to one another as they navigate the difficulties presented by this situation.</p><p>During this trying time, we want the friends and family of Brian to know that they are in our thoughts and that we share their sorrow. We want them to know that we are thinking of them and that we feel their loss. He leaves behind a lasting legacy in the world of cricket, and the cricketing community as well as all of those who knew him will remember him with fondness in the years to come. He leaves behind a legacy in the world of cricket that will last forever.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwrtGimKdll6qxqLHOp2SompmpwqK%2B2GabnpmknXqquoylpq%2Bhnpx6rrHMqKmyZZ%2BbeqO%2ByJqlZp%2BlmbSmu81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mully.html><span>←</span><span>Mully</span></a>
