Obviously, snagging football-themed clothing that shows your support for the guys playing is a top priority, so if you’re wondering where to buy Chiefs jerseys, sweatshirts, and the like, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p>Unfortunately, Chiefs gear is quickly selling out everywhere, or worse, won’t ship in time for Sunday. However, if you’re a fashion-loving Taylor Swift fan looking to buy Kansas City Chiefs apparel last-minute, you’re in luck. We’ve found a ton Chiefs and Travis Kelce-themed gear that look not only cool but come with creative nods that will be much appreciated at your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Super Bowl party</a>.</p><p>The list ahead is packed with fun stuff, and you might feel tempted to get something for yourself and your pal who’s less into the Love Story and more into, you know, the sport itself. But with just days to spare, you’d better act quickly. Place your order, ASAP, this way if Tay’s “guy on the Chiefs” does end up leaving with (another!) win, you’ll be Ready For It.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.41582914572864><h2>Nike Travis Kelce Kansas City Chiefs T-Shirt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Nike-Kelce-Tee.jpg><p>If you’re really committed to supporting Swift’s man, you’ll probably want some Chiefs gear that says his name and number.
