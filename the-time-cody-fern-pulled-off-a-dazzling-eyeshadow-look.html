The star has been known to wow on the red carpet with both his fashion choices and accompanying makeup, as reported by Wonderland. He first caught attention for his unconventional choices at the Golden Globes in 2019, when he wore a partially sheer shirt and winged eyeliner. “I had been playing the game of wearing the suit with the nice tie and trying to fit in,” he told Wonderland. “So doing that at the Golden Globes? It was actually for me. It was like shedding that skin.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaerW1zJ5knKeUrnqnsdGnZKmtnKGypXnOn51mmV2ZrrvGy6KloGWVrrK0tMCdprBlnKS8rHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mason-gooding.html><span>←</span><span>Mason Gooding Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
