I have six family members that came from out of town for this. They flew in for the ceremony,” said parent Kieta Archibald.</p><p>In an email sent to parents, Principal Eron Powell said the staff made the change due to recent safety concerns within the school community.</p><p>“This decision comes as a result of the cumulative impact of incidents and threats to our community. It is with a heavy heart we have made the decision,” Powell said in the letter.</p><p><b>ALSO SEE: Chicago middle school students walk out over safety after student made threatening drawing</b></p><p>According to Chicago police, there was an incident last Friday during the school day when an 18-year-old female hit and sprayed mace on another female. The offender was charged with a misdemeanor.</p><p>Parents and students were livid about the decision.</p><p>“It’s just messed up because this might be their only graduation. They might not go to college and walk again,” said 2022 graduate Darrion Jones.</p><p>“I think it’s shameful,” said fellow parent Bradley Fizer, “to make a decision of this magnitude and cheat everyone out of this moment.”</p><p>Jalon Lamar was hoping to walk across the stage and show off his academic achievement cords and medal with his family.</p><p>“I celebrated this myself. I didn’t do this by myself. I wanted everyone who helped me come and see me walk across the stage,” he said.</p><p>After many complaints, parents only were eventually allowed to watch their kids graduate.</p><p>“We let them know we weren’t standing for it,” said another parent, Latrina Jones.</p><p>With only 10 graduates at 15-minute intervals, graduation lasted all day. And to add insult to injury, by mid-afternoon, rain forced the modified ceremonies inside.</p><p>Copyright © 2022 WLS-TV.
