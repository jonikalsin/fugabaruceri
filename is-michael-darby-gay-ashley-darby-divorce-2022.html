The Truth Behind Allegations!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2022/04/is-michael-darby-gay-rhop-bravo-2022.jpg alt=is-michael-darby-gay-rhop-bravo-2022 width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Michael Darby is getting divorced from his wife Rachel Darby but there was a time where he was rumored to be gay.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a></strong></p><p>The allegations and speculation of Michael Darby being gay began when he was reportedly caught groping a male producer back in 2020. Though this incident sparked controversy, it wasn't the first time Michael let his wife face the scrutiny of his actions. Alongside being questioned about being gay, Michael was allegedly involved in infidelity, but the rumors of him being gay takes the cake!</p><p>With groping the male producer was the ultimate move that led many strongly speculate Michael was gay, it wasn't the only thing that led to the conclusion. Mr. Darby was reportedly found fooling around in Grindr; a gay dating app. Along with it, Michael was rumored to be in love with &nbsp;Juan Dixon.</p><p>Back in 2020 when Ashley featured in <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sarah Fraiser Show</a>, the RHOP got bombarded with questions regarding the very situation. Fraiser threw some bombing questions on Michael having a thing for Juan Dixon. In her defense, Ashley quickly retaliated saying,"“Here’s my thing, at this point, if I can be open now about my sexuality if I can be open about the fact that Michael and I have had threesomes if I am this forthcoming, it would be so much work to hide if my husband was interested in men."</p><p>Defending her husband against the allegations of him being gay, Ashley openly declared that if her husband was gay, there would be queue of people coming out the woodwork left, right and center at the point. Michael had also been found appreciating Mr. Dixon openly to which his wife again fortified saying, "Now, does he have a problem telling someone if they’re attractive? No. Male or female, no. Will he tell you if you’re ugly and busted? Yes!" Ashely left no crumbs while answering any questions that revolves around Michael being gay and getting up on the act.</p><p>As with the gropping incident, Darby was suspended by the production company during the investigation period. To complicate things worse, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a>, the man who was reportedly assaulted by Darby, <strong>Orville Palmer</strong>, was attempting to ensure that he does not get close to him again, assuming he ever did. The RHOP employee was also seeking a perpetual restraining order to keep Michael away from him in addition to bringing charges against him. As per the cameraman's claims, Darby allegedly offered a "flirtatious" look after squeezing Palmer's buttocks.</p><p>When Ashely was asked about the issue, she again defended her husband claiming that it was just "white boy culture" and that it didn't matter. That didn't stop suspicions that Michael Darby had a preference for guys, and it doesn't appear that they will stop now that another charge has surfaced.</p><p>In conclusion, though there's enough evidence that Michael Darby could actually be gay, his wife insists that he is not and the restaurant owner himself hasn't come out too to prove the claims right.</p><h2>Michael Darby and Ashely Darby have split! What's the reason behind their divorce?</h2><p></p><p>Ashley has stated that she and her husband are legally separated and intend to divorce after nearly eight years of marriage. According to a source close to the couple, a breakdown of trust between Ashley and Michael was indeed the tipping point for Ashley after years of infidelity suspicions.</p><p>Despite being beside Micheal through the storms and defending all the allegations that came up, Ashley revealed that it was too much for her to take in. Many fans of the show were not surprised when Ashley disclosed her and Michael's breakup in a statement to Bravo's <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Dish</a>. From the start, the marriage has had issues, including their significant age gap, cultural barriers, and, of course, adultery. Ashley also revealed to <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> that trust issues and inconsistency led her to give up on the relationship.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>In her final statement, Ashley said,"Pieces of all these may have affected our pure love for each other, but no one reason is the root cause of our mutual decision to go our separate ways," heavy heartedly she continued," We are now both at very different stages in our lives and have different goals for our futures. We both want the other to achieve true happiness and fulfillment and feel that we cannot do this together."</p><p><a href=#><strong>Get to Know</strong></a> your favorite celebrities and <a href=#><strong>Explore</strong></a> relationship details of <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> stars with <a href=#><strong>Celebs In-depth</strong></a>.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-170 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGigrGWdnrCprcSlZJ2ZopfGbrPAsmSaq5ihsrp5w5qpm7Fdmba3u9GcnGZqYGd%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-cameron-age-how-old-is-she-stv-news-newscaster-wiki-and-family.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Cameron Age | How Old Is She | STV News Newscaster Wiki And Family</span></a>
