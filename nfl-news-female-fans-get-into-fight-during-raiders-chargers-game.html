However, it seems like the action wasn’t only happening on the field. In the stands, multiple fan fights have been recorded and uploaded on social media.</p><p>In one such incident, two female Raiders fans were seen getting into a huge fight, resulting in a scuffle during the Raiders-Chargers game. In a one-minute-long video uploaded by TMZ on X, a woman in a <strong>Maxx Crosby</strong> jersey could be seen passionately arguing with another Raiders supporter, who was wearing a black tank top with the words Raiders printed on it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The woman in the Maxx Crosby jersey told the other woman to “Shut the f**k up and sit the f**k down” before getting into her face. The black tank top-wearing woman didn’t sit down, leading to the other woman getting agitated. The two started exchanging some heated words before the Crosby fan escalated things with violence.</p><p>She first knocked the drinks out of the other woman’s hand and started viciously slapping her face multiple times. The Crosby fan then proceeded to throw punches at the other Raiders fan, who tried to hit back with her own punches. But another woman jumped in support of the Crosby fan and started throwing punches at the tank top girl, resulting in an absolutely chaotic situation. Check out the footage of the scuffle attached below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Ultimately, some Raiders fans sitting near them stood up to split the women up and de-escalate the situation. It is unknown whether anyone involved in the fight was ejected or not for their role in the heated incident.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vikings CB Byron Murphy vows to subtly humiliate Travis Kelce in front of rumored girlfriend Taylor Swift this week</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-another-fan-fight-happened-in-the-same-raiders-chargers-game><strong>Another fan fight happened in the same Raiders-Chargers game</strong></h2><p>In a separate incident in the same game, a Chargers and a Raiders fan were caught fighting in a video.
