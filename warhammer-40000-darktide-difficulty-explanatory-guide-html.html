Difficulty Explanation The misconception…
The first level of difficulty (1-pip) is not “easy mode”.
It’s suitable for folks starting the game up til around trust level 12 or 14; around which most players will be using primarily white- and green-rarity gear."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The differences in map difficulty is not a matter of skill, but sheer numbers and stats.</p><p><strong>Difficulty scaling per pip?</strong></p><p>Elite enemies spawned at the same moment, the size and number of grunt swarms, as well as the amount of medium and heavy armor units mixed into said swarms…</p><p>These are things which are kicked up a notch per difficulty pip.</p><p>Typically, in 1-pip missions you will see an elite or two spawned together…</p><ul><li>In 2-pip missions, you’ll almost always find two elites spawned at once, maybe a third lesser sort such as a dog or mutant to try and throw off the squad.</li><li>In 3-pip missions, you’ll regularly see 3 elite units spawned at once… Maybe two special units on the side in addition.</li></ul><p>Beyond this, things start to get rather nutty. 4-pip and 5-pip missions are “hardcore” and “hell” respectively. Neither should be attempted unless you’re fully-leveled as a character and have the best possible gear you can acquire, in terms of both rarity, item/class perk synergy and so on.</p><p>…So until the full launch is out and we can modify gear, or you get god-rolls on it all, you should probably wait on that.</p><p><strong>In summary…</strong></p><p>Do not misunderstand the pips and the difficulty they imply.</p><p>Do not feel ashamed of playing 1-pip or 2-pip, they take up the majority of about the first few days of play as you work to level up and get higher-rarity gear with levels to match.</p><p>Typically, you’ll want to stick to 1-pip missions at most until you reach about lvl.14… 2-pip missions until lvl.28. When geared up with your favorite and hopefully more effective equipment at this point, you may be more able to challenge 3-pip missions barring special modifiers.</p><p>Take your time to learn the game’s mechanics, how to read the HUD and monitor allied health/ammo, etc on the fly. Master your weapons and determine how best to wield them, both which foes and which scenarios they excel against.</p><p>Learn their flaws and adopt tactics and styles which compensate.</p><p>And most importantly, learn how to operate as a squad.</p><p>Again</p><p>Do not rush into 2-pip (let alone 3-pip) missions with mere white-rarity, low-level equipment and less than lvl.10 under your belt at least.</p><p>“Lone wolves” and “speed-runners” are unacceptable within the ranks of the Astra Militarum.</p><h4>More Guides:</h4><ul><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Veteran “Make Every Shot Count” Penance Cheat Guide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Veteran “Make Every Shot Count” Penance Cheat Guide</a></li><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Lucius Helbore Lasgun Guide (with MK Stat Differences)">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Lucius Helbore Lasgun Guide (with MK Stat Differences)</a></li><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Psyker Force Staves Explanatory Guide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Psyker Force Staves Explanatory Guide</a></li><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Chasm Logistratum Scripture Locations">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Chasm Logistratum Scripture Locations</a></li><li><a href=# rel=bookmark title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Pro Tips for Ogryn">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide – Pro Tips for Ogryn</a></li></ul>Written by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Salty Sis' 4U</a><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaKysbjAsmWtoaCofKjByJ2crGenlr%2BprcymnKtlZGV9cXyMnZiro6SesaZ5w6Kdn6GTqrm1xYyer6mkkaOutbvRsmSgrZmZsm%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kirby-smart-coaching.html><span>←</span><span>Kirby Smarts Coaching Career History and Records: Number of Teams Coached by the Georgia HC</span></a>
